				<h2>About Me.</h2>
				<p>I'm a second-year at Northwestern University, on track to complete the Computer
					Engineering BS/MS program by 2025. My interests lie primarily in hardware, but
					I love learning about anything and everything computing-related. Feel free to explore
					the rest of my portfolio!

				<h2>Technical and Work Experience.</h2>
				<p>I've worked in both a semiconductor fabrication plant and an early-stage startup, with roles related
					to robotics (programming, deployment, and implementation). In the future, I hope to work in hardware
					verification and design, specifically in chip architecture.</p>

							Revised demonstrations involving autonomous pick-and-place using

						<!-- Full Description: Working on a medium-sized team, I led the development of standardized emergency
									eye wash station inspections into Spot mobile robot missions through Python programming
									and the Boston Dynamics API. I also developed a comprehensive training 
									manual covering Python basics and basic mission implementation. I integrated and deployed 
									demonstrations incorporating autonomous	pick-and-place with the Spot mobile robot created through 
									evaluating a pre-trained machine learning model with the TensorFlow object detection API, 
									LabelImg, NumPy, and Pandas. Within the sub-fabrication	environment, I designed testing methodology 
									to document and evaluate 120 different blockage and interference types, as well as inspected pumps, 
									blowers, and other support equipment. -->

									tending, and object quality inspections using Techman collaborative robots and OnRobot grippers. Using 
									RoboDK, I also developed multiple projects involving laser cutting, pick-and-place, and quality inspection.
									Furthermore, I aided in the construction of 6 educational cobot workstations, a machine tending cobot stand, 
									and an industrial tape dispenser & cutting machine. I also researched and compiled presentations on emerging software 
									and hardware competition and presented findings to Vice President, Sales Manager, and software developers using PowerPoint. -->
