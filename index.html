				<p>I'm a third-year at Northwestern University, on track to complete the Computer
					Engineering B.S./M.S. program by 2025. My interests lie primarily in hardware, but
					I love learning about anything and everything computing-related. Feel free to explore
					the rest of my portfolio!

								<h3>Education</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I'm currently finishing up my B.S. in Computer Engineering, set to start my 
								M.S. in Computer Engineering by April 2024. I'm also interested in pursuing a doctorate
								degree after the completion of my master's degree. I've currently taken courses in CMOS Circuit Design, 
								Signals & Systems, AI, Computer Systems, and Solid State Engineering.

								<h3>Skillset</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I'm constantly improving on my technical skillset in both hardware and software --
								I have experience in Python, Verilog, C/C++ and HTML. I've also had experience in structured
								problem solving in semiconductor manufacturing, had 5+ years of leadership experience, and 
								always look forward to working on a team.

							<p>More personally, I love playing and watching 
								basketball, weightlifting, playing the violin, skiing during the winter, 
								and building computers for friends whenever I get the chance. I'm also a huge
								foodie so wherever I am, you can bet that I'm trying all of the restaurants
								that I can!

				<h2>Technical and Work Experience.</h2>
				<p>I've worked in a semiconductor fab and an early-stage startup, with roles related
					to robotics (programming, deployment, and implementation) and process integration.
					In the future, I hope to work in hardware verification or design, but I'm open
					to all opportunities to learn about semiconductors!

									evaluating a pre-trained machine learning model with the TensorFlow object detection API, 
									LabelImg, NumPy, and Pandas. Within the sub-fabrication	environment, I designed testing methodology
